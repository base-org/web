# App Accounts

App Accounts enable developers to create and manage app-specific accounts for their applications. These accounts are linked to the user's Smart Wallet and can be utilized to sign transactions specifically for the app. This integration grants developers full control over the user experience, ensuring a seamless and cohesive interaction within the app.

## Technical Details

- Smart Wallet Ownership: The user's Smart Wallet acts as an owner of the app account, allowing it to manage and control the app-specific account.
- Key Agnostic: App Accounts are designed to be key agnostic. They leverage our Linked Accounts technology, which supports various key types including, but not limited to, in-browser CryptoKeys, Passkeys, traditional EOAs, and server wallets products.
- App Accounts can be used to sign transactions, messages, and EIP-712 typed data.
