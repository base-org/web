            <strong>&quot;SDKs&quot;</strong>), APIs, tags and local storage) on your computer or

          <h3 className="mt-4 text-lg font-medium">Strictly Necessary purposes</h3>
          <p>
            Strictly Necessary cookies are essential for our Services to function and therefore
            cannot be switched off. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you
            which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences,
            logging in, or filling in forms. These also include cookies we may rely on for security
            purposes, such as to prevent unauthorised access attempts. You can set your browser to
            block or alert you about these cookies at any time, but some features of our Services
            may not work.

          <p>
            We use these cookies to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve
            the performance of our Services. These cookies help us to know which pages are the most
            and least popular and see how visitors move around the Site, and to resolve any errors
            that occur on the Services quickly to provide you with a better experience. For example,
            our first party base_device_id cookie is used to provide analytics on how our Site and
            Services perform. This cookie lasts for 3 months.
