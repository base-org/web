One of the most intimidating tasks when building an onchain app is making that initial connection between your users' wallets, and your app. Initial research often surfaces a bewildering number of wallets, each with their own SDKs, and own methods to manage the connection. Luckily, you don't actually need to manage all of this on your own. There are a number of libraries specialized in creating a smooth and beautiful user experience to facilitate this connection.

## Connecting to the Blockchain

One of the many challenging tasks of building a frontend that can interface with your smart contracts is managing the user's connection between your onchain app and their [EOA] wallet. Not only is there an ever-growing suite of different wallets, but users can (and probably should!) use several different addresses within the same wallet app.

[Rainbowkit] is one of several options that makes this a little bit easier by serving as an aggregator of wallets, and handling some of the details of connecting them. Alternatives include [ConnectKit], and [Dynamic], which are both excellent choices as well.

Each of these include customizable UI/UX components for inviting the user to connect, displaying connection status, and selecting which wallet they wish to use.

### Using the Quick Start

If you're just trying to get up and running as quickly as possible, you can use RainbowKit's [quick start] script to scaffold an app from their template, with a single command. If you're using Yarn:

```bash
yarn create @rainbow-me/rainbowkit
```

:::info

The script doesn't accept `.` as a project name, so you'll want to run this script in your `src` directory, or wherever you keep your projects. It will create a folder with the same name as your project, and install the project files inside.

:::

Once it's done, simply run the app with:

```bash
yarn run dev
```

Using the script is fast, but it does mean less choice. In this case, it builds the app on top of [Next.js], which is great if you want to use it, but not helpful if you prefer to work from a different framework, such as [Create React App], or [Remix]. The script also doesn't help you if you want to add an onchain integration to an existing site.

## Conclusion

In this article, you've learned how libraries such as [Rainbowkit], [ConnectKit], and [Dynamic], aggregate wallets and make it easier for you to connect your app to your users' wallet of choice. You've also learned how you can use a template to quickly create the foundation of your app. Finally, you've learned that the cost of using a template is that it does make some choices for you.
