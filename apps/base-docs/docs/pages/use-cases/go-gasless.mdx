# Gasless Transactions on Base using Base Paymaster

Base transaction fees are typically less than a penny, but the concept of gas can still be confusing for new users and lead to poor user experience when users don't have gas funds in their wallet. You can abstract this away and improve your UX by using the **Base Paymaster**. The Paymaster allows you to:

- Batch multi-step transactions
- Create custom gasless experiences
- Sponsor up to $15k monthly on mainnet (unlimited on testnet)

:::tip
If you need an increase in your sponsorship limit, please [reach out on Discord][Discord]!
:::



## Objectives

1. Configure security measures to ensure safe and reliable transactions.
2. Manage and allocate resources for sponsored transactions.
3. Subsidize transaction fees for users, enhancing the user experience by making transactions free.
4. Set up and manage sponsored transactions on various schedules, including weekly, monthly, and daily cadences.



## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you have:

1. **A Coinbase Cloud Developer Platform Account**  
   If not, sign up on the [CDP site]. Once you have your account, you can manage projects and utilize tools like the Paymaster.

2. **Familiarity with Smart Accounts and ERC 4337**  
   Smart Accounts are the backbone of advanced transaction patterns (e.g., bundling, sponsorship). If you’re new to ERC 4337, check out external resources like the official [EIP-4337 explainer](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) before starting.

3. **Foundry**  
   Foundry is a development environment, testing framework, and smart contract toolkit for Ethereum. You’ll need it installed locally for generating key pairs and interacting with smart contracts.

:::tip
**Testnet vs. Mainnet**  
If you prefer not to spend real funds, you can switch to **Base Sepolia** (testnet). The steps below are conceptually the same. Just select _Base Sepolia_ in the Coinbase Developer Platform instead of _Base Mainnet_, and use a contract deployed on Base testnet for your allowlisted methods.
:::



## Set Up a Base Paymaster & Bundler

In this section, you will configure a Paymaster to sponsor payments on behalf of a specific smart contract for a specified amount.

1. **Navigate to the [Coinbase Developer Platform].**
2. Create or select your project from the upper left corner of the screen.
3. Click on the **Paymaster** tool from the left navigation.
4. Go to the **Configuration** tab and copy the **RPC URL** to your clipboard — you’ll need this shortly in your code.

### Allowlist a Sponsorable Contract

1. From the Configuration page, ensure **Base Mainnet** (or **Base Sepolia** if you’re testing) is selected.
2. Enable your paymaster by clicking the toggle button.
3. Click **Add** to add an allowlisted contract.
4. For this example, add [`0x83bd615eb93eE1336acA53e185b03B54fF4A17e8`][simple NFT contract], and add the function `mintTo(address)`.

:::info
**Use your own contract**  
 We use a [simple NFT contract][simple NFT contract] on Base mainnet as an example. Feel free to substitute your own.
:::



### Global & Per User Limits

Scroll down to the **Per User Limit** section. You can set:

- **Dollar amount limit** or **number of UserOperations** per user
- **Limit cycles** that reset daily, weekly, or monthly

For example, you might set:

- `max USD` to `$0.05`
- `max UserOperation` to `1`

This means **each user** can only have $0.05 in sponsored gas and **1** user operation before the cycle resets.

:::info
**Limit Cycles**  
These reset based on the selected cadence (daily, weekly, monthly).
:::

Next, **set the Global Limit**. For example, set this to `$0.07` so that once the entire paymaster has sponsored \$0.07 worth of gas (across all users), no more sponsorship occurs unless you raise the limit.

## Test Your Paymaster Policy

Now let’s verify that these policies work. We’ll:

1. Create two local key pairs (or use private keys you own).
2. Generate two Smart Accounts.
3. Attempt to sponsor multiple transactions to see your policy in action.

### Installing Foundry

1. Ensure you have **Rust** installed
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```
2. Install Foundry
   ```bash
   curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
   foundryup
   ```
3. Verify it works
   ```bash
   cast --help
   ```
   If you see Foundry usage info, you’re good to go!



### Create Your Project & Generate Key Pairs

1. Make a new folder and install dependencies, `viem` and `permissionless`:
   ```bash
   mkdir sponsored_transactions
   cd sponsored_transactions
   npm init es6
   npm install permissionless
   npm install viem
   touch index.js
   ```
2. Generate two key pairs with Foundry:
   ```bash
   cast wallet new
   cast wallet new
   ```
   You’ll see something like:
   ```bash
   Successfully created new keypair.
   Address: 0xD440D746...
   Private key: 0x01c9720c1dfa3c9...
   ```
   **Store these private keys somewhere safe**

### Project Structure With Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `sponsored_transactions` directory. In the `.env`, you'll add the rpcURL for your paymaster and the private keys for your accounts:

:::note[Find your Paymaster & Bundler endpoint]
The Paymaster & Bundler endpoint is the URL for your Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) Paymaster.
This was saved in the previous section and follows this format: `https://api.developer.coinbase.com/rpc/v1/base/<SPECIAL-KEY>`
Navigate to the [Paymaster Tool] and select the `Configuration` tab at the top of the screen to obtain your RPC URL.
:::

:::danger[Secure your endpoints]
You will create a constant for our Paymaster & Bundler endpoint obtained from cdp.portal.coinbase.com. The most secure way to do this is by using a proxy. For the purposes of this demo, hardcode it into our `index.js` file. For product, we highly recommend using a [proxy service].
:::

```bash
PAYMASTER_RPC_URL=https://api.developer.coinbase.com/rpc/v1/base/<SPECIAL-KEY>
PRIVATE_KEY_1=0x01c9720c1dfa3c9...
PRIVATE_KEY_2=0xbcd6fbc1dfa3c9...
```

:::danger
Never commit `.env` files to a public repo!
:::



## Example `index.js`

Below is a full example of how you might structure `index.js`.

```js twoslash
// --- index.js ---
// @noErrors

// 1. Import modules and environment variables
import 'dotenv/config';
import { http, createPublicClient, encodeFunctionData } from 'viem';
import { base } from 'viem/chains';
import { createSmartAccountClient } from 'permissionless';
import { privateKeyToSimpleSmartAccount } from 'permissionless/accounts';
import { createPimlicoPaymasterClient } from 'permissionless/clients/pimlico';

// 2. Retrieve secrets from .env
// Highlight: environment variables for paymaster, private keys
const rpcUrl = process.env.PAYMASTER_RPC_URL; // highlight
const firstPrivateKey = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY_1; // highlight
const secondPrivateKey = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY_2; // highlight

// 3. Declare Base addresses (entrypoint & factory)
const baseEntryPoint = '0x5FF137D4b0FDCD49DcA30c7CF57E578a026d2789';
const baseFactoryAddress = '0x15Ba39375ee2Ab563E8873C8390be6f2E2F50232';

// 4. Create a public client for Base
const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  chain: base,
  transport: http(rpcUrl),
});

// 5. Setup Paymaster client
const cloudPaymaster = createPimlicoPaymasterClient({
  chain: base,
  transport: http(rpcUrl),
  entryPoint: baseEntryPoint,
});

// 6. Create Smart Accounts from the private keys
async function initSmartAccounts() {
  const simpleAccount = await privateKeyToSimpleSmartAccount(publicClient, {
    privateKey: firstPrivateKey,
    factoryAddress: baseFactoryAddress,
    entryPoint: baseEntryPoint,
  });

  const simpleAccount2 = await privateKeyToSimpleSmartAccount(publicClient, {
    privateKey: secondPrivateKey,
    factoryAddress: baseFactoryAddress,
    entryPoint: baseEntryPoint,
  });

  // 7. Create SmartAccountClient for each
  const smartAccountClient = createSmartAccountClient({
    account: simpleAccount,
    chain: base,
    bundlerTransport: http(rpcUrl),
    middleware: {
      sponsorUserOperation: cloudPaymaster.sponsorUserOperation,
    },
  });

  const smartAccountClient2 = createSmartAccountClient({
    account: simpleAccount2,
    chain: base,
    bundlerTransport: http(rpcUrl),
    middleware: {
      sponsorUserOperation: cloudPaymaster.sponsorUserOperation,
    },
  });

  return { smartAccountClient, smartAccountClient2 };
}

// 8. ABI for the NFT contract
const nftAbi = [
  // ...
  // truncated for brevity
];

// 9. Example function to send a transaction from a given SmartAccountClient
async function sendTransaction(client, recipientAddress) {
  try {
    // encode the "mintTo" function call
    const callData = encodeFunctionData({
      abi: nftAbi,
      functionName: 'mintTo',
      args: [recipientAddress], // highlight: specify who gets the minted NFT
    });

    const txHash = await client.sendTransaction({
      account: client.account,
      to: '0x83bd615eb93eE1336acA53e185b03B54fF4A17e8', // address of the NFT contract
      data: callData,
      value: 0n,
    });

    console.log(`✅ Transaction successfully sponsored for ${client.account.address}`);
    console.log(`🔍 View on BaseScan: https://basescan.org/tx/${txHash}`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Transaction failed:', error);
  }
}

// 10. Main flow: init accounts, send transactions
(async () => {
  const { smartAccountClient, smartAccountClient2 } = await initSmartAccounts();

  // Send a transaction from the first account
  await sendTransaction(smartAccountClient, smartAccountClient.account.address);

  // Send a transaction from the second account
  // For variety, let’s also mint to the second account's own address
  await sendTransaction(smartAccountClient2, smartAccountClient2.account.address);
})();
```

Now that the code is implemented, lets run it:
Run this via `node index.js` from your project root.

```bash
node index.js
```

You should see a "Transaction successfully sponsored" output.

To confirm that your spend policies are correctly in place, try running the script again. If your Paymaster settings are strict (e.g., limit 1 transaction per user), the second time you run the script, you may get a “request denied” error, indicating the policy is working.



## Hitting Policy Limits & Troubleshooting

1. **Per-User Limit**  
   If you see an error like:

   ```json
   {
     "code": -32001,
     "message": "request denied - rejected due to maximum per address transaction count reached"
   }
   ```

   That means you’ve hit your **UserOperation** limit for a single account. Return to the [Coinbase Developer Platform] UI to adjust the policy.

2. **Global Limit**  
   If you repeatedly run transactions and eventually see:
   ```json
   {
     "code": -32001,
     "message": "request denied - rejected due to max global usd spend limit reached"
   }
   ```
   You’ve hit the **global** limit of sponsored gas. Increase it in the CDP dashboard and wait a few minutes for changes to take effect.



## Verifying Token Ownership (Optional)

Want to confirm the token actually minted? You can read the NFT’s `balanceOf` function:

```js
import { readContract } from 'viem'; // highlight

// example function
async function checkNftBalance(publicClient, contractAddress, abi, ownerAddress) {
  const balance = await publicClient.readContract({
    address: contractAddress,
    abi,
    functionName: 'balanceOf',
    args: [ownerAddress],
  });
  console.log(`NFT balance of ${ownerAddress} is now: ${balance}`);
}
```



## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you:

- Set up and **configured** a Base Paymaster on the Coinbase Developer Platform.
- **Allowlisted** a contract and specific function (`mintTo`) for sponsorship.
- Established **per-user** and **global** sponsorship **limits** to control costs.
- Demonstrated the **sponsorship flow** with Smart Accounts using `permissionless`, `viem`, and Foundry-generated private keys.

This approach can greatly improve your dApp’s user experience by removing gas friction. For more complex sponsorship schemes (like daily or weekly cycles), simply tweak your per-user and global limit settings in the Coinbase Developer Platform.

> **Next Steps**
>
> - Use a [proxy service][proxy service] for better endpoint security.
> - Deploy your own contracts and allowlist them.
> - Experiment with bundling multiple calls into a single sponsored transaction.
