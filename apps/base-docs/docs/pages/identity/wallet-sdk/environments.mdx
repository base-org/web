Coinbase Wallet SDK lets you connect your apps to Coinbase Wallet in the following ways:

- **Desktop web**: Automatically connects to Wallet extension or displays a QR code for users to connect with the Wallet mobile app.

- **Mobile browser**: Wallet SDK generates a dynamic deep link that takes users straight to your app in the Wallet mobile app browser.

- **App browser in Wallet**: Wallet SDK recognizes and connects to the injected web3 provider in Wallet's mobile app browser with no need for extra approvals.
