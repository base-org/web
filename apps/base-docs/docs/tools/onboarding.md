## Crossmint

[Crossmint](https://crossmint.com/?utm_source=backlinks&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=base) is an enterprise-grade web3 development platform that lets you deploy smart contracts, create email wallets, enable credit-card and cross chain payments, and use APIs to create, distribute, sell, store, and edit NFTs. By abstracting away the core complexities of the Blockchain, Crossmint allows you to build NFT applications without requiring any blockchain experience or holding cryptocurrency, and making the blockchain invisible to end users. Crossmint enables you to provide a Web2 experience for your Web3 apps and onboard users.

## Privy

[Privy](https://www.privy.io/) is a library designed for progressive user onboarding and authentication. It enables users to connect to your app using traditional methods such as email addresses, phone numbers, or social profiles, as well as through web3 methods like crypto wallets. Additionally, Privy supports embedded wallets, eliminating the need for users to have a self-custodial wallet prior to exploring your app. Privy is compatible with most EVM chains, including Base.

You can [get started with Privy here](https://docs.privy.io/guide/quickstart), and check out these starter repos for [building a Progressive Web App (PWA) on Base](https://github.com/privy-io/create-privy-pwa) and [using the Base Paymaster with Privy](https://github.com/privy-io/base-paymaster-example).

Using MPC-TSS for key management, Particle can streamline user onboarding via familiar web2 accounts - such as Google accounts, email addresses, and phone numbers. Particle Network's Smart Wallet-as-a-Service is compatible with most EVM chains, including Base.
