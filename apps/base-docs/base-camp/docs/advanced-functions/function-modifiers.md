Function modifiers allow you to efficiently change the behavior of functions. In some ways it's similar to inheritance, but there are restrictions, particularly in variable scope.

## Objectives

By the end of this lesson you should be able to:

- Use modifiers to efficiently add functionality to multiple functions

## Adding a Simple OnlyOwner Modifier

By default, `public` functions can be called by **anyone**, without restriction. Often this is desirable. You want any user to be able to see what NFTs are for sale on your platform, sign up for a service, or read various items stored in state.

However, there will be many functions you **don't** want any user to be able to do, such as setting the fee for using the dApp, or withdrawing all of the funds in the contract! A common pattern to protect these functions is to use `modifier`s to make sure that only the owner can call these functions.

:::caution

For a production dApp, you'll want to use a more robust implementation of `onlyOwner`, such as the [one provided by OpenZeppelin].

### Adding an Owner

The address of the deployer of a contract is **not** included as an accessible property. To make it available, add it as a state variable and assign `msg.sender` in the `constructor`.

```solidity
contract Modifiers {
    address owner;

    constructor () {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
}
```

### Creating an `onlyOwner` Modifier

[Modifiers] are very similar to functions and are declared with the `modifier` keyword. The modifier can run any Solidity code, including functions, and are allowed to modify state. Modifiers must have a special `_` character, which serves as a placeholder for where the code contained within the modified function will run.

Create a simple `onlyOwner` modifier, which returns an `error` of `NotOwner` with the sending address if the sender is not the owner.

```solidity
error NotOwner(address _msgSender);
```

```solidity
modifier onlyOwner {
    if (msg.sender != owner) {
        revert NotOwner(msg.sender);
    }
    _;
}
```

Test your `modifier` by adding a function that uses it:

```solidity
function iOwnThis() public view onlyOwner returns (string memory) {
    return "You own this!";
}
```

To test, deploy your contract and call the `iOwnThis` function. You should see the message "You own this!".

Next, switch the _Account_, and try the function again. You should see an error in the console:

```text
call to Modifiers.iOwnThis errored: VM error: revert.

revert
	The transaction has been reverted to the initial state.
Error provided by the contract:
NotOwner
Parameters:
{
 "_msgSender": {
  "value": "0x4B20993Bc481177ec7E8f571ceCaE8A9e22C02db"
 }
}
Debug the transaction to get more information.
```

:::caution

Always verify the output of a function call in the console. The result that appears under the button for the function is convenient, but it does **not** clear or change if a subsequent call reverts.

## Modifiers and Variables

Modifiers can have parameters, which essentially work the same as in functions. These parameters can be independent values, or they can overlap with the arguments provided to a function call.

### Modifiers with Parameters

Modifier parameters can be the arguments provided to the functions they modify. You can perform calculations and trigger errors based on these values.

```solidity
error NotEven(uint number);

modifier onlyEven(uint _number) {
    if(_number % 2 != 0) {
        revert NotEven(_number);
    }
    _;
}

function halver(uint _number) public pure onlyEven(_number) returns (uint) {
    return _number / 2;
}
```

### Independent Scope

While `modifiers` are used to modify functions and can share inputs, they have separate scope. The following example will **not** work:

```solidity
// Bad code example, does not work
modifier doubler(uint _number) {
    _number *= 2;
    _;
}

function modifierDoubler(uint _number) public pure doubler(_number) returns (uint) {
    return _number; // Returns the original number, NOT number * 2
}
```

---

## Conclusion

Function `modifier`s are an efficient and reusable way to add checks, trigger errors, and control function execution. In this lesson, you've seen examples of how they can be used to abort execution under certain conditions. You've also learned that they have separate scope and cannot be used to modify variables within the function they modify.
