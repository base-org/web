:::warning

Base Goerli does not yet support the new `PUSH0` opcode introduced in _Shanghai_, which is the default target for the Solidity compiler if you use version `0.8.20` or later. You will get an error when you attempt to deploy.

All exercises were built and tested with `0.8.17`. We recommend using this version until the upgrade.
