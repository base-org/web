There are two ways to integrate Coinbase Wallet into your Solana web applications:

## Injected Solana provider

The quickest way to integrate Coinbase Wallet into your Solana application is via the injected Solana provider.

Coinbase Wallet injects a provider into the top-level window of web applications at `window.coinbaseSolana`.
This provider provides a globally available API for your application to read on-chain data, establish connections to user accounts, sign messages, and send transactions.

## Solana wallet adapter

The **most recommended** way to integrate Coinbase Wallet into your Solana application is via [wallet adapters](https://solana-labs.github.io/wallet-adapter/).

The Solana Foundation provides a library of modular Typescript wallet adapters and components for Solana web applications. This library is great for developers that want to support multiple wallets, including Coinbase Wallet.

To get started using this library, check out our 'Getting started guide' or the official Solana wallet adapter [documentation](https://github.com/anza-xyz/wallet-adapter/blob/master/README.md).
