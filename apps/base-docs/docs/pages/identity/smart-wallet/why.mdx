# Why Smart Wallet?

## Instant Onboarding
Smart Wallet enables users to create an account in seconds with no app or extension required.

This is possible because Smart Wallet uses passkeys for signing. 
Passkeys are generated and stored securely on users' devices. 
If the user has iCloud or Google Password Manager, their passkeys will also be 
backed up and synced across devices [1](https://developer.apple.com/passkeys/), [2](https://developers.google.com/identity/passkeys/supported-environments). 

Note that this is *not* passkey authentication where a server stores a user's keys. Instead, a user's on-device passkey is [validated for signing onchain](https://github.com/base-org/webauthn-sol). 

## Zero Cost 
Smart Wallet is free for both developers and users.

## Unified Account Across Apps
Smart Wallet users can use the same account and address across all onchain apps. 

## MagicSpend
Smart Wallet users can connect their coinbase.com account and spend their coinbase.com held ETH from 
their Smart Account (Base only, for now).

## Batch Transactions, Paymasters, and more!
Our Smart Wallet is ERC-4337 compliant and our SDK supports batch transactions and app-defined paymasters.

## Coinbase Security
Users will see transaction and signing previews that will help keep them safe.
Our smart contracts have been audited 4 times by leading audit teams.
