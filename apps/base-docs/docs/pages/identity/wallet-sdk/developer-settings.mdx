:::info
Testnets are enabled by default for the Coinbase Wallet browser extension. When enabled, Testnet assets display separately from Mainnet assets in a dedicated Testnets tab.

## Show private key

View the private key associated with your wallet.

:::info
If `Show Private Key` is disabled, you are connected to the extension through your mobile app or your hardware wallet.

To export your private key and get full functionality, first sign out of the extension and import your seed phrase into Coinbase Wallet Extension.
