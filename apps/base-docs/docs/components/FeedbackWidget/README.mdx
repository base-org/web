# Feedback Widget Setup

This feedback widget allows users to provide feedback on documentation pages and stores the responses in a Google Sheet.

## Setup Instructions

1. Create a Google Cloud Project and enable the Google Sheets API
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)

2. Create Service Account Credentials
   - In the Google Cloud Console, go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "Service Account"
   - Fill in the service account details and create it
   - Create a new key for the service account (JSON format)
   - Download the JSON key file

3. Create a Google Sheet
   - Create a new Google Sheet
   - Share it with the service account email (with editor permissions)
