Welcome to the Coinbase Wallet developer documentation. Coinbase Wallet is a self-custody crypto wallet, available as a browser extension and a mobile app on Android and iOS.

## Coinbase Wallet features

Coinbase Wallet works with all EVM-compatible L1/L2 networks, supports NFTs, and is multi-platform (browser extension, iOS and Android mobile apps).

Learn more about Coinbase Wallet's [features](./wallet-features.mdx).

## Get started

You can integrate Coinbase Wallet into both web applications and native mobile applications.

### Web applications

There are two ways to integrate Coinbase Wallet into your web applications:

1. [Injected provider](./injected-provider.mdx): The top-level web3 provider injected by the Coinbase Wallet browser extension.
2. [Coinbase Wallet SDK](https://www.smartwallet.dev/sdk/install): An open source SDK which allows you to connect your applications to millions of Coinbase Wallet users.
3. Third-party libraries: The **most recommended** way to integrate. Open source libraries which allow you to easily add multi-wallet support within your web application (i.e. [wagmi](https://www.smartwallet.dev/guides/create-app/using-wagmi))

### Mobile applications

You can integrate Coinbase Wallet into your native mobile application via the [Coinbase Wallet Mobile SDK](./mobile-sdk-overview.mdx).

The SDK is available for the following platforms:

- [iOS](./ios-install.mdx)
- [Android](./android-install.mdx)
- [React Native](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@coinbase/wallet-mobile-sdk)
- [Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/coinbase_wallet_sdk)
