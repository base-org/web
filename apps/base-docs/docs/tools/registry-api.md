# [Beta] Onchain Registry API

---

:::info

The base url for our API endpoints is [https://base.org/api/registry/](https://base.org/api/registry/). Please note, this API is still in beta and should not be used in production environments. The use of Onchain Registry API is governed by the license terms outlined in our [Terms & Conditions](#terms--conditions).

:::

## Instructions

1. Users of this API can use the `/entries` and `/featured` endpoints to display Onchain Registry entries on their own surfaces
2. If your team would like to use referral codes to point your users to entries, we recommend appending your referral code to the link provided in the `target_url` field
3. If your team would like to filter entries based on where they are hosted or by creator, we recommend implementing logic based on the `target_url` and `creator_name` fields
