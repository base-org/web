## Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Differentiate between address and address payable types in Solidity
- Determine when to use each type appropriately in contract development
- Employ address payable to send Ether and interact with payable functions

## Ethereum Addresses

In Solidity, Ethereum addresses play a crucial role in interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. An Ethereum address is a 20-byte hexadecimal string that represents the destination of transactions or the owner of a smart contract. These addresses are used to send and receive Ether and interact with smart contracts.

### Addresses

Regular addresses in Solidity are used for various purposes, including:

- Identifying the owner of a smart contract
- Sending Ether from one address to another
- Checking the balance of an address
  Here's an example of declaring a regular address variable in Solidity:

<br />

```solidity
address public owner;
```

### Payable Addresses

`payable` keyword is a language-level feature provided by Solidity to enable the handling of Ether within smart contracts, and it is not a feature of the Ethereum Virtual Machine itself, but rather a part of the Solidity language's syntax. They are used when you want a contract to be able to receive Ether from external sources, such as other contracts or user accounts.

Payable addresses are often used when creating crowdfunding or token sale contracts, where users send Ether to the contract's address in exchange for tokens or to fund a project.

Here's an example of declaring a payable address variable in Solidity:

```solidity
address payable public projectWallet;
```

Payable [Address] are marked as payable, which means they can accept incoming Ether transactions. It's important to note that regular addresses cannot receive Ether directly.

## Receiving Ether with Payable Addresses

To receive Ether in a contract using a payable address, you need to define a payable function that can accept incoming transactions. This function is typically named receive or fallback. Here's an example:

```solidity
fallback() external payable {
    // Handle the incoming Ether here
}
```

In this example, the fallback function is marked as external and payable, which means it can receive Ether when someone sends it to the contract's address. You can then add custom logic to handle the received Ether, such as updating contract balances or triggering specific actions.

## Usage

```solidity
contract PaymentReceiver {
    address payable owner;

    constructor() payable {
        owner = payable(msg.sender); // Convert msg.sender to payable
    }

    function receiveEther() public payable {
        // This function can receive Ether
    }

    function withdrawEther() public {
        owner.transfer(address(this).balance); // Send Ether to owner
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Appropriately using address and address payable types is essential for secure and efficient Solidity contract development. By understanding their distinctions and applying them correctly, you can effectively manage Ether transfers and interactions within your contracts.
