## API3

[API3](https://api3.org/) is building secure first-party oracles for Base.

API3 is live with:

- [dAPIs](https://docs.api3.org/guides/dapis/subscribing-managed-dapis/): First-party aggregated data feeds sourced directly from the data providers.
- [Airnode](https://docs.api3.org/guides/airnode/calling-an-airnode/): The first-party serverless Oracle solution to bring any REST API onchain.
- [QRNG](https://docs.api3.org/guides/qrng/): Quantum Random Number Generator for verifiable quantum RNG onchain.

#### Supported Networks

- Base Mainnet
- Base Goerli (Testnet)

## Chainlink

[Chainlink](https://chain.link/) provides a number of [price feeds](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses/?network=base) for Base.

See [this guide](https://docs.chain.link/docs/get-the-latest-price/) to learn how to use the Chainlink feeds.

:::info

To use Chainlink datafeeds, you may need [LINK](https://docs.chain.link/resources/link-token-contracts?parent=dataFeeds) token.

## Supra 

[Supra](https://supraoracles.com) provides VRF and decentralized oracle price feeds that can be used for onchain and offchain use-cases such as spot and perpetual DEXes, lending protocols, and payments protocols. Supra’s oracle chain and consensus algorithm makes it one of the fastest-to-finality oracle providers, with layer-1 security guarantees. The pull oracle has a sub-second response time. Aside from speed and security, Supra’s rotating node architecture gathers data from 40+ data sources and applies a robust calculation methodology to get the most accurate value. The node provenance on the data dashboard also provides a fully transparent historical audit trail. Supra’s Distributed Oracle Agreement (DORA) paper was accepted into ICDCS 2023, the oldest distributed systems conference.

Visit the Supra [documentation](https://supraoracles.com/docs/) to learn more about integrating Supra's oracle and VRF into your Base project.
