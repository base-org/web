# wallet_watchAsset

Defined in [EIP-747](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-747)

> Allows suggesting a token to be added to a user's wallet. This method is used to request that the user tracks a specific token in their wallet. The wallet may prompt the user to approve the addition of the token and may reject the request if the token is already being tracked or if the parameters are invalid.

## Parameters

```ts
interface WatchAssetParams {
  /**
   * The type of asset to watch
   * Currently only 'ERC20' is supported
   */
  type: string
  /**
   * The options for the asset being watched
   */
  options: {
    /**
     * The token contract address
     */
    address: string
    /**
     * A ticker symbol or shorthand, up to 11 characters
     */
    symbol: string
    /**
     * The number of token decimals
     */
    decimals: number
    /**
     * A string URL of the token logo
     */
    image?: string
  }
}

type WatchAssetParamsType = [WatchAssetParams]
```

## Returns

`boolean`

Returns `true` if the token was added successfully (the user approved the request and the token was successfully added to their wallet), `false` otherwise (the request was rejected or failed).
