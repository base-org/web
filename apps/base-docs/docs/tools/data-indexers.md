## Covalent

[Covalent](https://www.covalenthq.com/?utm_source=base&utm_medium=partner-docs) is a hosted blockchain data solution providing access to historical and current on-chain data for [100+ supported blockchains](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/networks/?utm_source=base&utm_medium=partner-docs), including [Base](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/networks/base/?utm_source=base&utm_medium=partner-docs).

Covalent maintains a full archival copy of every supported blockchain, meaning every balance, transaction, log event, and NFT asset data is available from the genesis block. This data is available via:

1. [Unified API](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/unified-api/?utm_source=base&utm_medium=partner-docs) - Incorporate blockchain data into your app with a familiar REST API
2. [Increment](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/increment/?utm_source=base&utm_medium=partner-docs) - Create and embed custom charts with no-code analytics

To get started, [sign up](https://www.covalenthq.com/platform/?utm_source=base&utm_medium=partner-docs) and visit the [developer documentation](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/?utm_source=base&utm_medium=partner-docs).

#### Supported Networks

- [Base Mainnet](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/networks/base/?utm_source=base&utm_medium=partner-docs)
- [Base Goerli](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/networks/base/?utm_source=base&utm_medium=partner-docs) (Testnet)

## Envio

[Envio](https://envio.dev) is a full-featured data indexing solution that provides application developers with a seamless and efficient way to index and aggregate real-time and historical blockchain data for any EVM. The indexed data is easily accessible through custom GraphQL queries, providing developers with the flexibility and power to retrieve specific information. 
  
Envio [HyperSync](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/hypersync) is an indexed layer of the Base blockchain for the hyper-speed syncing of historical data (JSON-RPC bypass). What would usually take hours to sync ~100,000 events can now be done in the order of less than a minute.

Designed to optimize the user experience, Envio offers automatic code generation, flexible language support, multi-chain data aggregation, and a reliable cost-effective hosted service.

To get started, visit the [documentation](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/overview) or follow the [quickstart](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/quickstart) guide.


#### Supported Networks

- Base Mainnet
- Base Goerli (Testnet)

## Shovel

[Shovel](https://indexsupply.com/shovel) is an [open source](https://github.com/indexsupply/code) tool for synchronizing Ethereum data to your Postgres database. Shovel can index block data, transaction data, and decoded event data. A single Shovel can index multiple chains simultaneously. Shovel is configured via a declarative JSON config file â€“no custom functions to save indexed data to your database.

Find out more in the [Shovel Docs](https://indexsupply.com/shovel/docs/)

#### Supported Networks

- Base Mainnet
- Base Goerli (Testnet)
- Base Sepolia (Testnet)

## SubQuery

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network/) is a data indexer that provides developers with fast, reliable, decentralized, and customized APIs for accessing rich indexed data from over 80+ ecosystems (including Base) within their projects.

SubQuery provides the ability to aggregate this data across multiple blockchains all within a single project.

Other advantages of SubQuery includes performance with multiple RPC endpoint configurations, multi-worker capabilities and a configurable caching architecture.

To get started, visit the [developer documentation](https://academy.subquery.network/) or follow [this step-by-step guide](https://academy.subquery.network/quickstart/quickstart_chains/base-goerli.html) on how to index any smart contract on Base.

#### Supported Networks

- [Base Mainnet](https://academy.subquery.network/quickstart/quickstart_chains/base.html)
- [Base Goerli](https://academy.subquery.network/quickstart/quickstart_chains/base-goerli.html) (Testnet)

## The Graph

[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is an indexing protocol for organizing blockchain data and making it easily accessible with GraphQL.

Base applications can use GraphQL to query open APIs called subgraphs, to retrieve data that is indexed on the network. With The Graph, you can build serverless applications that run entirely on public infrastructure.

To get started, visit the [documentation](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/) or see [this quickstart](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/cookbook/quick-start/) on how to create, deploy, and query a subgraph.

#### Supported Networks

- [Base Mainnet](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/#supported-networks)
- [Base Goerli](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/#supported-networks) (Testnet)

## Flair

[Flair](https://flair.dev) is a real-time and historical custom data indexing for any EVM chain.

It offers reusable **indexing primitives** (such as fault-tolerant RPC ingestors, custom processors and aggregations, re-org aware database integrations) to make it easy to receive, transform, store and access your on-chain data.

To get started, visit the [documentation](https://docs.flair.dev) or clone the [starter boilerplate](https://github.com/flair-sdk/starter-boilerplate) template and follow the instructions.

#### Supported Networks

- [Base Mainnet](https://docs.flair.dev/reference/manifest.yml)
- [Base Goerli](https://docs.flair.dev/reference/manifest.yml) (Testnet)
