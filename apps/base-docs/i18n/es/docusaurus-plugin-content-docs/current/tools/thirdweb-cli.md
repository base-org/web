# thirdweb CLI

thirdweb provides an interactive command line interface, allowing you to create, build and deploy your smart contracts and apps.

You can use the thirdweb CLI to create and deploy smart contracts to the Base network.

Visit the [thirdweb documentation](https://portal.thirdweb.com/cli) for more instructions on using the thirdweb CLI.
