# Defi Your App
When businesses and individuals make financial transactions, it often includes swapping assets and then storing eligible assets in a yield generating strategy. This guide will show you how to quickly add these features to your app with pre-built React components from OnchainKit.

## Ready-to-use components
- [`<Swap />`](/builderkits/onchainkit/swap/swap): Swap assets directly within your app.
- [`<Earn />`](/builderkits/onchainkit/earn/earn): Generate yield directly within your app.
- [`<FundCard />`](/builderkits/onchainkit/fund/fund-card): Fund their wallets with fiat (via USDC, Apple Pay, or debit card) without leaving your app.
- [`<Buy />`](/builderkits/onchainkit/buy/buy): Purchase tokens directly within your app.


By embedding the `Swap` and `Earn` components, your users don't need to leave your app to execute these common actions. For users who lack onchain funds, the `Fund` and `Buy` components offer an integrated fiat-to-crypto onramp.


## Swap Component Integration

The `Swap` component lets users exchange one token for another directly in your application. It fetches live quotes, builds transactions, and executes swaps—abstracting the underlying complexity.

Lets add the `Swap` component to your app.

:::steps
### Install and Configure OnchainKit
   Create a new OnchainKit app

   ```bash [Terminal]
   npm create onchain@latest
   ```

### Import and Render the Swap Component

   ```typescript [App.tsx]
        import { SwapDefault } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/swap'; // [!code focus]
        import type { Token } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/token';

        const eth: Token = {
        name: 'ETH',
        address: '',
        symbol: 'ETH',
        decimals: 18,
        image:
            'https://wallet-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/tokens/eth_288.png',
        chainId: 8453,
        };

        const usdc: Token = {
        name: 'USDC',
        address: '0x833589fcd6edb6e08f4c7c32d4f71b54bda02913',
        symbol: 'USDC',
        decimals: 6,
        image:
            'https://d3r81g40ycuhqg.cloudfront.net/wallet/wais/44/2b/442b80bd16af0c0d9b22e03a16753823fe826e5bfd457292b55fa0ba8c1ba213-ZWUzYjJmZGUtMDYxNy00NDcyLTg0NjQtMWI4OGEwYjBiODE2',
        chainId: 8453,
        };

        <SwapDefault // [!code focus]
        from={[eth]} // [!code focus]
        to={[usdc]} // [!code focus]
        /> // [!code focus]
   ```
:::

You should now see the following swap component in your app:

<App>
    <SwapWrapper>
        {({ address, swappableTokens }) => {
        if (address) {
            return (
            <SwapDefault from={swappableTokens} to={swappableTokens.slice().reverse()} disabled />
            )
        }
        return <>
            <Wallet>
            <ConnectWallet>
                <Avatar className="h-6 w-6" />
                <Name />
            </ConnectWallet>
            </Wallet>
        </>;
        }}
    </SwapWrapper>
</App>

The Swap component uses **Uniswap V3** as the default router, but you can also use the **0x Aggregator** by setting the `experimental.useAggregator` prop to `true`.



### Swap Settings
The Swap component comes preconfigured but is highly cusotomizable. Just a couple of the settings you can customize:
- Swap settings
- bidirectional or unidiectional swaps
- Gasless swaps with paymasters

To learn more about how to customize the Swap component, check out the [Swap docs](/builderkits/onchainkit/swap/swap).


## Earn Component Integration

The `Earn` component enables users to deposit assets into yield-generating vaults and withdraw them later—all within your app. The `Earn` component currently supports Morpho vaults on Base.

:::note[Get a vault address]
You can get a vault address from Morpho's [Vaults page](https://app.morpho.org/base/earn). You will use this address when setting up the `Earn` component.
:::

```tsx twoslash
// @noErrors: 2307
import { Earn } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/earn'; // [!code focus]

<Earn vaultAddress="0x7BfA7C4f149E7415b73bdeDfe609237e29CBF34A" /> // [!code focus]
```

Just like that, you've added a yield-generating vault to your app.

<EarnMain />

### Advanced Customizations
Similar to the Swap component, the Earn component is highly customizable. Lets customize our component to include custom deposit buttons for a streamlined user experience.

- `useEarnContext` to access the component's context values, `EarnDeposit` and `EarnDetails`
- `DepositButton` to render custom deposit buttons

:::code-group

```tsx twoslash [index.tsx]
// @noErrors: 2307
import { Earn, useEarnContext } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/earn';
import { CustomDepositButtons } from '@/custom-deposit-buttons';

  <Earn vaultAddress="0x7BfA7C4f149E7415b73bdeDfe609237e29CBF34A">
      <CustomDepositButtons />
  </Earn>

```

```tsx twoslash [custom-deposit-buttons.tsx]
import {EarnDetails,
        EarnDeposit,
        useEarnContext,
        DepositButton} from '@coinbase/onchainkit/earn';

const predefinedAmounts = ['0.1', '1', '10'];

function CustomDepositButtons() {
  const { depositAmount, setDepositAmount } = useEarnContext();

  return (
    <EarnDeposit>
      <EarnDetails />
      <div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-2">
        {predefinedAmounts.map((amount) => {
          const selected = amount === depositAmount;
          return (
            <button
              key={amount}
              type="button"
              onClick={() => setDepositAmount(amount)}
              className={`rounded-md px-4 py-2
              ${selected ? 'bg-[var(--ock-bg-primary)] text-[var(--ock-text-inverse)]'
              : 'bg-[var(--ock-bg-secondary)] text-[var(--ock-text-primary)]'}`}
            >
              {amount}
            </button>
          );
        })}
      </div>
      <DepositButton />
    </EarnDeposit>
  );
}
```
:::

<PredefinedInputDeposit />

## Onboarding Users in DeFi

In order to leverage the `<FundCard/>` and `<Buy />` components, users need to have funds in their wallet. If user's don't have funds, they'll need to onramp fiat or buy tokens in order to transact. We'll explore two out-of-the-box solutions from OnchainKit below.

The `Fund` component (via `<FundCard />`) offers a complete fiat onramp experience, allowing users to add funds to their wallet directly in your app.  It provides:
- Amount input with fiat/crypto switching
- Payment method selection (Coinbase, Apple Pay, Debit Card)
- Automatic exchange rate updates
- Smart handling of payment method restrictions (based on country and subdivision)

::::tip
To use the `FundCard` component, you'll need to provide a Client API Key in `OnchainKitProvider`. You can get one following our [Getting Started](/builderkits/onchainkit/installation/nextjs#get-your-client-api-key) steps.
:::::

```tsx [App.tsx]
import { FundCard } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/fund';

<FundCard
  assetSymbol="ETH"
  country="US"
  currency="USD"
/>;
```

<App>
  <FundWrapper>
    {({ address }) => {
      if (address) {
        return <FundCard assetSymbol="ETH" country="US" currency="USD" />;
      }
      return (
        <>
          <Wallet>
            <ConnectWallet>
              <Avatar className="h-6 w-6" />
              <Name />
            </ConnectWallet>
          </Wallet>
        </>
      );
    }}
  </FundWrapper>
</App>

To learn more about the `FundCard` component and its features, check out the [FundCard docs](/builderkits/onchainkit/fund/fund-card).

## The `Buy` Component

The `Buy` components provide a comprehensive interface for users to purchase [Tokens](/builderkits/onchainkit/token/types#token).

The `Buy` component supports token swaps from USDC and ETH by default with the option to provide an additional token of choice using the `fromToken` prop. Users are able to purchase tokens using their Coinbase account, Apple Pay, or debit card.

:::info
This component requires a `projectId` to be set in the `OnchainKitProvider`. You can find your `projectId` on [Coinbase Developer Platform](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/products/onchainkit).
:::

```tsx twoslash
import { Buy } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/buy'; // [!code focus]
import type { Token } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/token';

export default function BuyComponents() { // [!code focus]
  const degenToken: Token = {
    name: 'DEGEN',
    address: '0x4ed4e862860bed51a9570b96d89af5e1b0efefed',
    symbol: 'DEGEN',
    decimals: 18,
    image:
    'https://d3r81g40ycuhqg.cloudfront.net/wallet/wais/3b/bf/3bbf118b5e6dc2f9e7fc607a6e7526647b4ba8f0bea87125f971446d57b296d2-MDNmNjY0MmEtNGFiZi00N2I0LWIwMTItMDUyMzg2ZDZhMWNm',
    chainId: 8453,
  };

  return ( // [!code focus]
    <Buy toToken={degenToken} /> // [!code focus]
  ) // [!code focus]
} // [!code focus]

```

<App>
  <BuyWrapper>
    {({ address, toToken }) => {
      return (
        <Buy toToken={toToken} disabled />
      )
    }}
  </BuyWrapper>
</App>

:::danger
**Note: This interface is for demonstration purposes only.**

Swap and Onramp flows will execute and work out of the box when you implement the component in your own app.
:::

By combining Swap, Earn, Fund, and Buy with these additional tools, you can quickly build a robust in-app DeFi experience with minimal development overhead. This lets you focus on building your unique value proposition.


## Next Steps

If you're using these components, its likely you'll benefit from the following components:

- [`<Transaction/>`](/builderkits/onchainkit/transaction/transaction): Provides a high-level transaction interface for executing custom onchain transactions.


- [`<TokenChip/>`](/builderkits/onchainkit/token/token-chip): Offers utilities for token selection and display, ideal for building wallet-like interfaces.


- [`<WalletIsland/>`](/builderkits/onchainkit/wallet/wallet-island): An advanced, draggable wallet widget that consolidates wallet management (QR code, buy options, swap, portfolio view) in one interface.


### Go Gasless
For the `<Buy />` and `<Swap/>` components, you can enable gasless transactions by setting the [`isSponsored`](/builderkits/onchainkit/buy/buy#sponsor-gas-with-paymaster) prop to `true`.
