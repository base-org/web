# Single Sign On

Smart Wallet is a single sign on for onchain apps. Users bring the same account, identity, and assets across apps.

## How it works

1. Smart Wallet relies on [passkeys](/identity/smart-wallet/features/passkeys), stored on users' devices, which can be used on our website (keys.coinbase.com) and [mobile app](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet). 
2. Our SDK, which developers integrate into their apps, uses keys.coinbase.com popups to allow users to see requests and sign with their passkey. 
3. The SDK and the popup use cross domain messaging to share information back to the app.
