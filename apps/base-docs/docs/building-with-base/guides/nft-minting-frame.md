## Objectives

By the end of this lesson you should be able to:

- Programmatically generate and return json metadata for ERC-721 tokens
- Deterministically construct unique svg art in a smart contract
- Generate deterministic, pseudorandom numbers

---

## Prerequisites

### ERC-721 Tokens

This guide assumes that you are able to write, test, and deploy your own ERC-721 tokens using the Solidity programming language. If you need to learn that first, check out our content in [Base Camp] or the sections specific to [ERC-721 Tokens]!

### Onchain App Development

You'll need to be comfortable building onchain apps.

---

## Setup

Start by creating a project with the [Build Onchain Apps Template]. Follow the setup instructions in the README and be sure to set an environment variable for wallet connect.
