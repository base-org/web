import CookieManager from '../src/components/CookieManager';

This Cookie Policy explains how Base (referred to here as **"we"**, **"us"** and **"our"**)
uses cookies and similar technologies when you visit [base.org](https://base.org) (the
**"Site"**) and/or when you explore and use Base through the Base protocol or any other
applications, tools, and features we operate (collectively referred to as the **"Services"**).
It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to
control our use of them.

In some cases, we may use cookies and similar technologies to collect personal information,
or information that becomes personal information if we combine it with other information.
In such cases, the [Base Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy) will apply
in addition to this Cookie Policy.

## 1. What Are Cookies?

Browser cookies are text files with small pieces of data downloaded onto your computer or
mobile device. Browser cookies and other similar technologies enable websites and apps to
store information or facilitate access to information stored on your device to enable
certain features and distinguish you from other visitors. These technologies are used by
most website and app providers to let users navigate between pages efficiently, ensure
security of the webpage or application, understand how their websites are used, remember
user preferences and generally improve the user experience. More information on cookies
and their use can be found at [aboutcookies.org](https://www.aboutcookies.org) or
[allaboutcookies.org](https://www.allaboutcookies.org). Cookies set by the website operator
are called **"first party cookies"** and Cookies set by parties other than the website
operator are called **"third party cookies"**. You should check the third-party's website
for more information on how they use cookies.

## 2. What Do We Use Cookies For?

When you access our Site and Services, we, or companies we work with, may place cookies
(collectively called **"cookies"** in this Cookie Policy) and similar technologies (such as
web beacons, software development kits (**"SDKs"**), APIs, tags and local storage) on your
computer or other device for the following purposes:

### Strictly Necessary purposes

Strictly Necessary cookies are essential for our Services to function and therefore
cannot be switched off. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you
which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences,
logging in, or filling in forms. These also include cookies we may rely on for security
purposes, such as to prevent unauthorised access attempts. You can set your browser to
block or alert you about these cookies at any time, but some features of our Services
may not work.

### Performance purposes

We use these cookies to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve
the performance of our Services. These cookies help us to know which pages are the most
and least popular and see how visitors move around the Site, and to resolve any errors
that occur on the Services quickly to provide you with a better experience. For example,
our first party base_device_id cookie is used to provide analytics on how our Site and
Services perform. This cookie lasts for 3 months.

## 3. How to Manage Cookies, Similar Technologies and Targeted Online Mobile Advertising
