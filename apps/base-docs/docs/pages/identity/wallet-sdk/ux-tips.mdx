Coinbase Wallet SDK, or Wallet SDK, has been fully rebranded from its former name of WalletLink.

## Mobile UX guidance

- Use [responsive web design](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design) to ensure your app is easy to use on mobile.
- Consider implementing autoconnect/1-click connect on mobile, to simplify the wallet connection experience.
  - **Autoconnect:** Your app automatically connects to the injected provider with no user action needed.
    1. On page load, check if an injected wallet is present
    2. If yes, then on page load immediately call `ethereum.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' })` using either
       - Coinbase Wallet SDK or
       - the injected provider
  - **1-click connect:** Your app provides one "Connect to Wallet" button.
    1. Provide one button for the user to press to connect their wallet
    1. On click, check if an injected wallet is present and if so, call `ethereum.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' })` using either
       - Coinbase Wallet SDK or
       - the injected provider
  
  For either option, if no injected wallet is present, use whatever wallet flow you prefer.

## Other guidance

- Label the connection as “Coinbase Wallet” for clarity to users.

- Download the Coinbase Wallet icon set: [coinbase_wallet_logo_kit.zip](https://github.com/coinbase/coinbase-wallet-sdk/raw/master/assets/coinbase_wallet_logo_kit.zip).
  
- Have Coinbase Wallet appear above the fold for users to discover without clicking on “Show More”.
