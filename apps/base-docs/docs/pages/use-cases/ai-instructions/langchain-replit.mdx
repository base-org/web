:::warning[Security of wallets on Replit]

Every agent comes with an associated wallet. Wallet data is read from wallet_data.txt, and if that file does not exist, this repl will create a new wallet and persist it in a new file. Please note that this contains your wallet's private key and should not be used in production environments. Refer to the [CDP docs](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/wallet-api/docs/wallets#securing-a-wallet) on how to secure your wallets.
