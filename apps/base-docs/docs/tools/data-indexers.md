## Covalent

[Covalent](https://www.covalenthq.com/?utm_source=base&utm_medium=partner-docs) is a hosted blockchain data solution providing access to historical and current on-chain data for [100+ supported blockchains](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/networks/?utm_source=base&utm_medium=partner-docs), including [Base](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/networks/base/?utm_source=base&utm_medium=partner-docs).

Covalent maintains a full archival copy of every supported blockchain, meaning every balance, transaction, log event, and NFT asset data is available from the genesis block. This data is available via:

1. [Unified API](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/unified-api/?utm_source=base&utm_medium=partner-docs) - Incorporate blockchain data into your app with a familiar REST API
2. [Increment](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/increment/?utm_source=base&utm_medium=partner-docs) - Create and embed custom charts with no-code analytics

To get started, [sign up](https://www.covalenthq.com/platform/?utm_source=base&utm_medium=partner-docs) and visit the [developer documentation](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/?utm_source=base&utm_medium=partner-docs).

## DipDup
[DipDup](https://dipdup.io) is a Python framework for building smart contract indexers. It helps developers focus on business logic instead of writing a boilerplate to store and serve data. DipDup-based indexers are selective, which means only required data is requested. This approach allows to achieve faster indexing times and decreased load on underlying APIs.

To get started, visit the [documentation](https://dipdup.io/docs/supported-networks/base) or follow the [quickstart](https://dipdup.io/docs/quickstart-evm) guide.

## Envio

[Envio](https://envio.dev) is a full-featured data indexing solution that provides application developers with a seamless and efficient way to index and aggregate real-time and historical blockchain data for any EVM. The indexed data is easily accessible through custom GraphQL queries, providing developers with the flexibility and power to retrieve specific information.

Envio [HyperSync](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/hypersync) is an indexed layer of the Base blockchain for the hyper-speed syncing of historical data (JSON-RPC bypass). What would usually take hours to sync ~100,000 events can now be done in the order of less than a minute.

Designed to optimize the user experience, Envio offers automatic code generation, flexible language support, multi-chain data aggregation, and a reliable, cost-effective hosted service.

To get started, visit the [documentation](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/overview) or follow the [quickstart](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/quickstart) guide.

## GhostGraph

[GhostGraph](https://GhostGraph.xyz/) makes it easy to build blazingly fast indexers (subgraphs) for smart contracts.

GhostGraph is the first indexing solution that lets you write your index transformations in **Solidity**. Base dApps can query data with GraphQL using our hosted endpoints.

To get started, you can [sign up for an account](https://app.ghostlogs.xyz/ghostgraph/sign-up) and follow [this quickstart](https://docs.ghostlogs.xyz/category/-getting-started-1) guide on how to create, deploy, and query a GhostGraph.

## The Indexing Company

[The Indexing Company](https://www.indexing.co/) provides indexing as a service, capable of indexing any chain (EVM and non-EVM) with an RPC endpoint and integrating off-chain data within the same infrastructure.

Our services include data transformations, aggregations, and streamlined data flows, allowing teams to develop their products faster while saving on developer resources, time, and money. Our solution is ideal for teams needing advanced data engineering for modular chain setups, multi-chain products, L1/L2/L3 chains and AI.

To get started contact us [here](https://www.indexing.co/get-in-touch).

## Moralis

[Moralis](https://moralis.io/?utm_source=base-docs&utm_medium=partner-docs) offers comprehensive data APIs for crypto, offering both indexed and real-time data across 15+ chains. Moralis' APIs include portfolio and wallet balances, NFT data, token data, price data, candlestick data, net worth data, and a lot more. All of the data is enriched with things like metadata, parsed events and address labels.

To get started with Moralis, you can [sign up for an account](https://moralis.io/?utm_source=base-docs&utm_medium=partner-docs), visit the Moralis [documentation](https://docs.moralis.io/?utm_source=base-docs&utm_medium=partner-docs), or check out their tutorials on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/MoralisWeb3).

## Nexandria

[Nexandria](https://www.nexandria.com/?utm_source=base-docs&utm_medium=partner-docs) API offers access to complete historical on-chain data at blazing speeds, arbitrary granularity (as low as block-level) and at viable unit economics (think web2 level costs). Our technology lets you generate subgraphs on the fly, unlocking unique endpoints like a statement of all the balance transfers for all the tokens, or a list of all the neighbors of an address with all the historical interaction details or a portfolio balance graph covering all the tokens across arbitrary time/block ranges.

## Shovel

[Shovel](https://indexsupply.com/shovel) is an [open source](https://github.com/indexsupply/code) tool for synchronizing Ethereum data to your Postgres database. Shovel can index block data, transaction data, and decoded event data. A single Shovel can index multiple chains simultaneously. Shovel is configured via a declarative JSON config file â€“ no custom functions to save indexed data to your database.

## The Graph

[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is an indexing protocol for organizing blockchain data and making it easily accessible with GraphQL.

Base applications can use GraphQL to query open APIs called subgraphs, to retrieve data that is indexed on the network. With The Graph, you can build serverless applications that run entirely on public infrastructure.

To get started, visit the [documentation](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/) or see [this quickstart](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/cookbook/quick-start/) on how to create, deploy, and query a subgraph.
