## Best Practices
Some apps check user's onchain balance and block certain interactions if the user
has insufficient funds. This is a problem for MagicSpend users, who can access
their Coinbase funds during the transaction flow.

Apps can detect whether the connected address may have other funds accessible 
via `auxiliaryFunds` capability, which can be discovered via a [`wallet_getCapabilities` RPC call](https://eip5792.xyz/reference/getCapabilities).
If a user has `auxiliaryFunds`, apps should not block interactions based on onchain balance.
