# Bug bounty program

In line with our strategy of being the safest way for users to access crypto:

- Coinbase will be extending our [best-in-industry](https://www.coinbase.com/blog/celebrating-10-years-of-our-bug-bounty-program) million-dollar [HackerOne bug bounty program](https://hackerone.com/coinbase?type=team) to cover the Base network, the Base bridge contracts, and Base infrastructure.
- Coinbase will be working in tandem with OP Labs to harden the security guarantees of Bedrock and accelerate the timeline for decentralized fault-proofs on the [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/).
- Coinbase's bug bounty program will run alongside Optimism's existing [Immunefi Bedrock bounty program](https://immunefi.com/bounty/optimism/) to support the open source [Bedrock](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/releases/bedrock/) OP Stack framework.
