If a user has both Metamask and Coinbase Wallet extensions installed, connecting to the injected provider can lead to a situation where both extensions raise a pop-up window to connect wallet.

If you are using `window.ethereum` to support Metamask on your app, you can prevent this scenario with the following code snippet, which specifies that your injected provider option only works with Metamask:

```javascript
const connectWallet = async () => {
  if (typeof window.ethereum !== 'undefined') {
    let provider = window.ethereum;
    // edge case if MM and CBW are both installed
    if (window.ethereum.providers?.length) {
      window.ethereum.providers.forEach(async (p) => {
        if (p.isMetaMask) provider = p;
      });
    }
    await provider.request({
      method: 'eth_requestAccounts',
      params: [],
    });
  }
};
```

Use this pattern to access your provider throughout the app.
