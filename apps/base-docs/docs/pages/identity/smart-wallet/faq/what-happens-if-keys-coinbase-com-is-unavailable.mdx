# What happens if keys.coinbase.com is unavailable?

<Callout type="warning">
  Generate a recovery key before you need it. Recovery keys are essential for maintaining access to your wallet if keys.coinbase.com becomes unavailable.
</Callout>

Since passkeys are tied to the keys.coinbase.com domain, if the domain becomes unavailable, users will need a recovery key to access their wallet. This is why we strongly recommend generating a recovery key as a backup.

For instructions on generating and using recovery keys, please see our [Recovery Keys documentation](/identity/smart-wallet/features/recovery-keys).
