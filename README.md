## Setup

1. Ensure `nvm` is [installed](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script).
2. Clone the repository.
3. If `nvm` doesn't auto-load the Node.js environment when changing to the repo directory, run `nvm use`.
4. Enable Yarn by running `corepack enable`.

## Getting started

After cloning the repository begin by installing dependencies at the root.

```shell
yarn
yarn build
```

## Local development

To start a development server on localhost, run `yarn workspace @app/<project> dev`.

For example, to start the `web` app locally, you would run `yarn workspace @app/web dev`.

## Projects

There are three projects which can be run individually.

### Web

```
yarn workspace @app/web dev
```

yarn workspace @app/base-docs dev
```

### Updating the Base Ecosystem Page

If you're a builder who wants to add or update your project on the [Base Ecosystem](https://base.org/ecosystem) page, follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository.

2. Create a new branch for your changes.

3. Update the `web/apps/web/src/data/ecosystem.json` with your project information. All fields are required. Each entry should follow this format:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "Your Project Name",
     "tags": ["category"],
     "description": "A brief description of your project (less than 200 characters)",
     "url": "https://your-project-url.com",
     "imageUrl": "/images/partners/your-project-logo.png"
   }
   ```

   - name: Your project's name
   - tags: An array with _one_ of the following categories: `bridge`, `dao`, `defi`, `gaming`, `infra`, `nft`, `onramp`, `social`, `wallet`, `security`
   - description: A brief description of your project, must be less than 200 characters
   - url: Your project's website URL
   - imageUrl: Path to your project's logo image

4. When adding and/or updating a logo, place a 192x192 pixel PNG file in the `web/apps/web/public/images/partners/`. The file should be named appropriately (e.g., your-project-name.png). The logo should be an App Store or Play Store iconographic version, not a full wordmark.

5. Create a pull request with your changes.
