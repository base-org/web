You've already built and deployed your [Basic Math] contract for this exercise. Now it's time to submit the address and earn an NFT pin to commemorate your accomplishment!

:::caution

We're currently in beta, so you'll only need to pay testnet funds to submit your contract, but this means you'll be getting a testnet NFT.

Stay tuned for updates!
