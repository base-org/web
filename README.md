# Base Web

## Setup

1. Ensure `nvm` is [installed](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script).
2. Clone the repository.
3. If `nvm` doesn't auto-load the Node.js environment when changing to the repo directory, run `nvm use`.
4. Enable Yarn by running `corepack enable`.

## Getting started

After cloning the repository begin by installing dependencies at the root.

```shell
yarn
yarn build
```

## Local development

To start a development server on localhost, run `yarn workspace @app/<project> dev`.

For example, to start the `web` app locally, you would run `yarn workspace @app/web dev`.

### Web

```
yarn workspace @app/web dev
```
