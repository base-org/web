### Be familiar with modern, frontend web development

In this tutorial, you'll be working with a React frontend built with [Next.js]. While you don't need to be an expert, we'll assume that you're comfortable with the basics.

### Possess a general understanding of the EVM and smart contract development

This tutorial assumes that you're reasonably comfortable writing basic smart contracts. If you're just getting started, jump over to our [Base Learn] guides and start learning!

### Understand providers and connectors

### Coinbase Wallets

You need to have both the [Coinbase Wallet] and [Coinbase Smart Wallet] for this tutorial. You need to set up the [Coinbase Wallet] in advance, but you can create a smart wallet during the tutorial.
