This page explains how to fetch accounts from a Web3 provider.

## Getting Ethereum accounts with EIP-1102

Use <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EIP-1102</a> to obtain authorization and get Ethereum accounts. Invoking EIP-1102 shows a QR code dialog if the user's mobile wallet is not already connected to your app.

The following code runs in response to a user-initiated action such as clicking a button to ensure the pop up is not blocked by the browser.

```typescript
// Use eth_requestAccounts
ethereum.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' }).then((response) => {
  const accounts: string[] = response as string[];
  console.log(`User's address is ${accounts[0]}`);

  // Optionally, have the default account set for web3.js
  web3.eth.defaultAccount = accounts[0];
});

// ethereum.enable() is now deprecated in 4.0.0
ethereum.enable().then((accounts: string[]) => {
  console.log(`User's address is ${accounts[0]}`);
  web3.eth.defaultAccount = accounts[0];
});
```

Once the user obtains authorization, the Web3 object (`web3`) and the Web3 Provider (`ethereum`) are ready to be used.

:::info

If you were using `ethereum.on("accountsChanged")`, remove it and obtain addresses with EIP-1102 callbacks instead. It was removed to improve compatibility with the latest `web3.js`.
