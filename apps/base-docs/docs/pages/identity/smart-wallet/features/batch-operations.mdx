# Batch Operations

Smart Wallet supports batch operations, which allow developers to perform multiple operations in a single transaction. 
This is useful for reducing the number of transactions required to perform a complex operation, such as a swap or a multi-step transaction.

## Technical Details

- Batch operations are facilitated via the [wallet_sendCalls](https://www.eip5792.xyz/reference/sendCalls) RPC.
