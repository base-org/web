## Covalent

[Covalent](https://www.covalenthq.com/?utm_source=base&utm_medium=partner-docs) is a hosted blockchain data solution providing access to historical and current on-chain data for [100+ supported blockchains](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/networks/?utm_source=base&utm_medium=partner-docs), including [Base](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/networks/base/?utm_source=base&utm_medium=partner-docs).

Covalent maintains a full archival copy of every supported blockchain, meaning every balance, transaction, log event, and NFT asset data is available from the genesis block. This data is available via:

1. [Unified API](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/unified-api/?utm_source=base&utm_medium=partner-docs) - Incorporate blockchain data into your app with a familiar REST API
2. [Increment](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/increment/?utm_source=base&utm_medium=partner-docs) - Create and embed custom charts with no-code analytics

To get started, [sign up](https://www.covalenthq.com/platform/?utm_source=base&utm_medium=partner-docs) and visit the [developer documentation](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/?utm_source=base&utm_medium=partner-docs).

#### Supported Networks

- [Base Mainnet](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/networks/base/?utm_source=base&utm_medium=partner-docs)
- [Base Goerli](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/networks/base/?utm_source=base&utm_medium=partner-docs) (Testnet)

## SubQuery

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network/) is a data indexer that provides developers with fast, reliable, decentralized, and customized APIs for accessing rich indexed data from over 80+ ecosystems (including Base) within their projects.

SubQuery provides the ability to aggregate this data across multiple blockchains all within a single project.

Other advantages of SubQuery includes performance with multiple RPC endpoint configurations, multi-worker capabilities and a configurable caching architecture.

To get started, visit the [developer documentation](https://academy.subquery.network/) or follow [this step-by-step guide](https://academy.subquery.network/quickstart/quickstart_chains/base-goerli.html) on how to index any smart contract on Base.

#### Supported Networks

- [Base Mainnet](https://academy.subquery.network/quickstart/quickstart_chains/base.html)
- [Base Goerli](https://academy.subquery.network/quickstart/quickstart_chains/base-goerli.html) (Testnet)

## The Graph

[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is an indexing protocol for organizing blockchain data and making it easily accessible with GraphQL.

Base applications can use GraphQL to query open APIs called subgraphs, to retrieve data that is indexed on the network. With The Graph, you can build serverless applications that run entirely on public infrastructure.

To get started, visit the [documentation](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/) or see [this quickstart](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/cookbook/quick-start/) on how to create, deploy, and query a subgraph.

#### Supported Networks

- [Base Mainnet](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/#supported-networks)
- [Base Goerli](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/#supported-networks) (Testnet)
