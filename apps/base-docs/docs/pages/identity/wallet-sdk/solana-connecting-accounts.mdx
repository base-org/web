## Connecting

To establish a connection to a user's account, call the `connect` method on the provider.

```javascript
try {
  await window.coinbaseSolana.connect();
} catch (err) {
  // { method: 'connect', message: 'Connection error' }
}
```

If the user accepts the request and the connection is successful, the `publicKey` field is set to the [PublicKey](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/PublicKey.html) of the connected account, and the `isConnected` field is set to `true`.

```javascript
window.coinbaseSolana.publicKey.toString();
// J7VKAb39Vgxar55cFtzLu8QJ2dwS9MrV7NyQJoUK1yDa
window.coinbaseSolana.isConnected;
// true
```

If the user rejects the request to connect, an error is thrown.

## Disconnecting

To disconnect a user's account from your application, call the `disconnect` method on the provider.

```javascript
await window.coinbaseSolana.disconnect();
```

If the userâ€™s account is disconnected, the `publicKey` field is set to `null`, and the `isConnected` field is set to `false`.
