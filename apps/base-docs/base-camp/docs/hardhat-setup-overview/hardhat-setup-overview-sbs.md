In this article, you'll learn about Hardhat: a development framework to create, test and deploy smart contracts to Ethereum and other supported EVM chains.

---

## Objectives

By the end of this lesson you should be able to:

- Install and create a new Hardhat project with Typescript support
- Describe the organization and folder structure of a Hardhat project
- List the use and properties of hardhat.config.ts

## Overview

[Hardhat] is a development environment that allows you to develop and test Solidity on your local machine. It includes debugging and unit testing tools, and has an ecosystem of third-party-developed plugins that ease development and deployment.

Among other things, these plugins can help you deploy contracts, see the size of your compiled byte-code, and even see unit test coverage.

## Installing Hardhat and creating a new project

As pre-requisite to start developing smart contracts with Hardhat you need to have Node.js installed.

Then we can simply type ``npx hardhat init`. This command will give you a set of options to bootstrap a Hardhat project.

üë∑ Welcome to Hardhat v2.11.2 üë∑‚Äç

? What do you want to do? ‚Ä¶
‚ùØ Create a JavaScript project
  Create a TypeScript project
  Create an empty hardhat.config.js
  Quit
```

Our recommendation is to select "Create a TypeScript project". Since it gives you some benefits like static typing that can reduce the number of errors during development.

Then we say yes for the remaining options, that include installing the package `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox` that contains some of the most used Hardhat plugins.

```
‚úî What do you want to do? ¬∑ Create a TypeScript project
‚úî Hardhat project root: ¬∑ {any location}
‚úî Do you want to add a .gitignore? (Y/n) ¬∑ y
‚úî Do you want to install this sample project's dependencies with npm (hardhat @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox)? (Y/n) ¬∑ y
```

### Anatomy of a Hardhat project

Once we complete the previous step, we will have a folder structure like:

- contracts # our contracts will go here
- hardhat.config.ts # configuration file for hardhat
- node_modules # node.js package folder
- package-lock.json # node.js package lock file
- package.json # node.js package file
- scripts # we place our scripts here
- test # we place our tests here
- tsconfig.json # typescript configuration file

It is also common to have our hardhat tasks in a `task` folder.

It is important to mention that all these paths are fully configurable in the `hardhat.config.ts`. So we could specify a different folder for our contracts, i.e `src`.

### Configuration

The hardhat.config.ts is the file where we can configure our Hardhat environment.

Since our project is using Typescript, we have the benefit of having static typing.

The following is the default configuration.

```
import { HardhatUserConfig } from "hardhat/config";
import "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox";

const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
  solidity: "0.8.17",
};

export default config;
```

We can configure aspects like:

- default network
- networks
- solidity
- paths
- mocha

For example:

```
import { HardhatUserConfig } from "hardhat/config";
import "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox";

const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
  defaultNetwork: 'base',
  networks: {
    base: {
      url: "https://goerli.base.org",
      accounts: ["<private key 1>"]
    },
    sepolia: {
      url: "https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/<key>",
      accounts: ["<private key 1>", "<private key 2>"]
    }
  },
  solidity: {
    version: "0.8.17",
    settings: {
      optimizer: {
        enabled: true,
        runs: 200
      }
    }
  },
  paths: {
    sources: "./contracts",
    tests: "./test",
    cache: "./cache",
    artifacts: "./artifacts"
  }
};

export default config;
```

## Compiling smart contracts

At this point you should have a Hardhat project up and running to start developing smart contracts. You may notice Hardhat includes a sample contract called `Lock.sol`.

We are going to run our first command: `npx hardhat compile`. This command will compile our smart contracts and generate the correct [artifacts](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/advanced/artifacts), that includes the bytecode and ABI.

After running the command `npx hardhat compile` we should be able to see a new folder called artifacts. That includes each contract name as folder and a {ContractName}.json file.
