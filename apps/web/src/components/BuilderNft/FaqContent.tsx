              onchain Builder Quest
            </a>{' '}
            shortly after we brought Base to testnet. Builders who completed the quest got a
            commemorative NFT on Base testnet designed by Andre Oshea. Our vision was to enable
            builders to keep a piece of onchain history with them as the earliest Base builders.
            Now, holders of the testnet NFT can claim their NFT on mainnet.
