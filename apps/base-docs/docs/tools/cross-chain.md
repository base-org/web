## Axelar

[Axelar](https://axelar.network/) is an interchain platform that connects blockchains to enable universal web3 transactions. By integrating with Axelar, applications built on Base can now easily send messages and assets between the 49+ blockchains connected via Axelar.

To learn more about Axelar visit our [docs](https://docs.axelar.dev/). For complete end-to-end examples demonstrating various Axelar usecases please visit the available [code examples](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-examples)

#### Supported Networks

- [Base Mainnet](https://docs.axelar.dev/resources/mainnet)
- [Base Testnet](https://docs.axelar.dev/resources/testnet)

#### Axelarscan

To view current transactions and live stats about the Axelar network please visit the [Axelarscan block explorer](https://axelarscan.io/)

## LayerZero

[LayerZero](https://layerzero.network/) is an omnichain interoperability protocol that enables cross-chain messaging. Applications built on Base can use the LayerZero protocol to connect to 35+ supported blockchains seamlessly.

To get started with integrating LayerZero, visit the LayerZero [documentation](https://layerzero.gitbook.io/docs/evm-guides/master/how-to-send-a-message) and provided examples on [GitHub](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/solidity-examples)

#### Supported Networks

- [Base Mainnet](https://layerzero.gitbook.io/docs/technical-reference/mainnet/supported-chain-ids)
- [Base Goerli](https://layerzero.gitbook.io/docs/technical-reference/testnet/testnet-addresses#layerzero-endpoints-testnet) (Testnet)

## Wormhole

[Wormhole](https://wormhole.com/) is a generic messaging protocol that provides secure communication between blockchains.

By integrating Wormhole, a Base application can access users and liquidity on > 30 chains and > 7 different platforms.

See [this quickstart](https://docs.wormhole.com/wormhole/quick-start/tutorials/hello-wormhole) to get started with integrating Wormhole in your Base project.

For more information on integrating Wormhole, visit their [documentation](https://docs.wormhole.com/wormhole/) and provided [GitHub examples](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-examples).

#### Supported Networks

- [Base Mainnet](https://docs.wormhole.com/wormhole/blockchain-environments/evm#base)
- [Base Goerli](https://docs.wormhole.com/wormhole/blockchain-environments/evm#base) (Testnet)
