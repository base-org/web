### How do you withdraw from Base?

Connect your wallet and confirm that it is set to Base network. Choose the digital asset you wish to bridge back to Ethereum mainnet and confirm you want to withdraw.

After your withdrawal request is proposed onchain (within an hour) you must verify and complete the transaction in order to access your funds. You can track your progress under the transaction tab.

This seven day bridge duration is in place as a [challenge period](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bridge/messaging/#fees-for-l2-%E2%87%92-l1-transactions) security measure built into the OP Stack.

If you prefer not to wait, instead of making a withdrawal using Base Bridge, you also have the option to utilize a [third-party bridge](https://base.org/ecosystem?tag=bridge) for quicker withdrawals.

### How do I verify my withdrawal transaction?

Navigate to the [Transactions](https://bridge.base.org/transactions) page. Next to your transaction, use the button to "Switch to L1". This action will ask you to switch to the Ethereum Mainnet network, enabling you to proceed with the verification process.

Proceed to then use the same button which will update to a new status enabling you to "Verify" your withdrawal. This action will prompt you to complete verification with your wallet by signing a transaction.

Seven days after you have verified your withdrawal, you can complete your withdrawal by returning to the Transactions page. Use the "Complete" button which will appear next to your transaction.
