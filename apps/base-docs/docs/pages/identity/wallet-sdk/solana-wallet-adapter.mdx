The Solana Foundation provides a library of modular Typescript wallet adapters and components for Solana web applications. This library is great for developers who want to support multiple wallets, including Coinbase Wallet.

To get started using this library, check out our 'Getting started guide' or the official Solana wallet adapter [documentation](https://solana-labs.github.io/wallet-adapter/).
