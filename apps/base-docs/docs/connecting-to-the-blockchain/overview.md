# Overview of Connecting to the Blockchain

These guides show you how to connect your frontend to the blockchain using JSON RPC blockchain providers, and the [RainbowKit], [wagmi], and [viem] stack.

---

## Objectives

By the end of these guides, you should be able to:

### Blockchain Providers

- Compare and contrast public providers vs. vendor providers vs. wallet providers
- Select the appropriate provider for several use cases

### Connecting with a Provider

- Set up a provider in wagmi and use it to connect a wallet
- Protect API keys that will be exposed to the front end

## Prerequisites

### 1. Be familiar with modern, frontend web development

In this guide, we'll be working with a React frontend built with [Next.js]. While you don't need to be an expert, we'll assume that you're comfortable with the basics.

### 2. Possess a general understanding of the EVM and smart contract development

These guides assume that you're reasonably comfortable writing basic smart contracts. If you're just getting started, jump over to our [Basecamp] guides and start learning!
