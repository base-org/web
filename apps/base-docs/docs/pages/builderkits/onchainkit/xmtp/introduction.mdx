# Introduction to XMTP utilities

OnchainKit has a collection of utilities that allows you to build Frames with the XMTP protocol.

## Metadata

To build a Frame with XMTP, you must first add XMTP metadata. This is done using the `getFrameMetadata` function.

```ts
const frameMetadata = getFrameMetadata({
  /**
   * Frame metadata like Image, Buttons, Input, etc.
   */
  isOpenFrame: true,
  accepts: { xmtp: 'vNext' },
});

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  /**
   * ...other metadata
   */
  other: {
    ...frameMetadata,
  },
};
```

- `isOpenFrame`: A boolean that indicates whether the Frame is open or not.
- `accepts`: An object that indicates the versions of the Frame that the Frame supports.

## Handling XMTP Frames

When a user interacts with a Frame inside an XMTP client application, you will need to handle the payload slightly differently from an interaction coming from Farcaster. The primary identifier for a user on Farcaster is the `fid`, while in XMTP it is the `verifiedWalletAddress`.

In order to get the `verifiedWalletAddress` you must install `@xmtp/frames-validator` in your Frame, alongside Onchainkit.

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install @coinbase/onchainkit @xmtp/frames-validator
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @coinbase/onchainkit @xmtp/frames-validator
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @coinbase/onchainkit @xmtp/frames-validator
```

```bash [bun]
bun add @coinbase/onchainkit @xmtp/frames-validator
```

:::

To assist you in handling interactions from XMTP, and extracting the `verifiedWalletAddress` from a POST payload, here is the XMTP utilities which includes:

- [XMTP](./introduction)
  - Utilities:
    - [`getXmtpFrameMessage`](./get-xmtp-frame-message)
    - [`isXmtpFrameRequest`](./is-xmtp-frame-request)
